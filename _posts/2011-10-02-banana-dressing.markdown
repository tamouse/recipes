This would go great on fruit salads.


## Ingredients
* 1 medium ripe banana, cut into chunks
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice


## Directions

Combine ingredients in blender and blend until smooth.

Plain, non-fat yoghurt would work well instead of the sour cream.

Adding poppy seeds to this would be marvelous.
