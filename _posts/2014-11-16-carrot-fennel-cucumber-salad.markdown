* 1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced
* 1 cucumber, thinly sliced
* 1/2 cup fresh mint, chopped
* 4 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 2 Tbsp canola oil

#### Directions

1.  Combine carrots, fennel, cucumber, and mint in a large bowl.

2.  Mix lemon juice and canola oil in a container with a securable lid. Tighten lid and shake.

3.  Pour dressing over salad and toss gently.
