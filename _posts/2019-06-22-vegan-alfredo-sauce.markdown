This looked like a good recipe to try with my still-new allergies to dairy and sensitivity to gluten. I modified it a bit to suit myself, but it's a pretty straight-forward recipe.


## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegan butter
- 4 - 6 large cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound cauliflower, cut into florets (about 1 medium head)
- 1/2 cup raw cashews, unsalted
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth, low sodium
- 15 oz can of coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, more to taste
- 1 teaspoon granulated onion
- 3/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste (seems like a lot)
- pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. In a large pan or pot (that can be fitted with a lid), heat the butter over medium heat. When melted, add the garlic and saute for 1 minute until lightly browned.

2. Add the broth, cauliflower, and cashews. Raise heat to bring to a boil. Now turn heat down to a low simmer and cover with lid. Cook for 10-12 minutes until cauliflower is fork tender. Remove from heat, and let cool.

3. To a high-speed blender, add coconut milk, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, granulated onion, salt, pepper, and the cooked contents from the pan. Blend on high until smooth. Taste for seasoning and add more if needed. Pour mixture back into the pan and cook on medium-low to warm up a bit.
