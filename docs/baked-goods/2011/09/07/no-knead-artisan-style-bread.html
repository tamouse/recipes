    <p>No kneading makes this an easy bread recipe.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>1 2/3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary (optional)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme (optional)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and mix to combine. Add the water and herbs, if using, and mix well. The dough will be very sticky and shaggy-looking. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 18 to 24 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generously flour a work surface. The dough will have risen and will be covered in bubbles. Transfer the dough to the work surface and dust it with flour. Fold the dough in half, and then form the dough into a ball by stretching and tucking the edges of the dough underneath the ball.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberally flour a kitchen towel (do not use terrycloth). Place the dough ball on the floured towel. Cover with another floured towel. Let the dough rise for about two hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a lidded Dutch oven or deep heavy duty casserole dish (with lid) into the oven to preheat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carefully remove the hot baking dish from the oven. Remove the lid and gently turn the dough ball into the ungreased baking dish, seam-side up; shake the dish so the dough is more evenly distributed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the loaf from the baking dish and let it cool on a rack before slicing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="editors-note">Editor’s Note</h2>

<p>To ensure the dough is fully risen and ready for the oven, do the Poke
Test: flour your index and middle fingers, and poke the side of your
loaf about half an inch deep. If the indentations spring back, the
dough still needs more time to rise. When the indentations stay put,
the loaf is ready to bake.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been baking no-knead bread ever since the original recipe came
  out in the New York Times several years ago, so trust me when I tell
  you it is not recommended that you remove the baking vessel from the
  oven after you’ve just spent 30 minutes heating it. Do NOT remove it
  from the oven, just pour the dough (batter, really) into the baking
  vessel and then cover and bake. That way you don’t lose the heat you
  just spent half an hour to achieve to heat the pan. Also, there’s no
  need to shake the dough once it’s in the pan, it’ll spread by itself
  while baking. It’s really a misnomer to call this a dough, because it
  really comes out as a batter. I agree with the other reviewer that
  it’s impossible to form it into any kind of a ball ‘cause it’s just
  too sticky. And forget the step of placing it on a towel to
  raise. It’s just messy and doesn’t achieve anything more than if you
  just stir it and place it in a bowl and let it rise another 2
  hours. That said, I would rate this a 4, only because I think the
  instructions are not the best way to make this bread.</p>
