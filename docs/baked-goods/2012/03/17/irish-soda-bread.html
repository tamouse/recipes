    <p>This recipe looks so simple, and looks so NOMMY! It originally came
from “Cooking with Julia” and was posted at
<a href="http://www.foodbuzz.com/blogs/5229627-irish-soda-bread">foodbuzz</a>. This will be my first foray into
baking something more complex than drop biscuits, cake or
cookies. This looks easy enough that I’m sure it will turn out!</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>4 Cups Flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>2 cups Buttermilk</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Preheat oven to 375&amp;degF;. Make sure to position your rack in the middle of the oven.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This way you don’t have to grease a pan. You can just put the dough right onto the sheet. Set this aside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a large bowl put together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir together with a fork until all ingredients are incorporated. Add the buttermilk and stir vigorously until the dough comes together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (keep some extra flour handy this dough is VERY sticky). Knead the dough gently for a minute. Do not knead too much! The dough should be soft and malleable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pat the dough into a disk about 6 inches across and slash and X across the top of the dough. The X should be about 1/2 an inch deep. I know that seems a bit deep, but do it, you will see what it does when it bakes. Place the dough onto the baking sheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bake the dough for about 50 minutes or until the dough is golden brown on top. Transfer it to a rack to cool for a few minutes and then slice. Serve warm.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From <a href="http://ravienomnoms.wordpress.com/2012/03/15/irish-soda-bread/">RavieNomNom’s</a> blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, because of the low fat content in the bread it doesn’t last
  very long. Will be as hard as a blarney stone in 2 days so make sure
  if you make this you plan on eating all of it, or plan on throwing
  some out for your birds to enjoy. I have found that if you put it
  away immediately after dinner (possibly while still a little warm),
  it will last about 2 days. That 3rd day though? Forget it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will be my first foray into baking, when I make this. I’m looking
forward to it!</p>
