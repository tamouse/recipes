    <p>Another version of the Dutch Baby.</p>

<p>From Williams-Sonoma catalog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chef Cole Dickinson, Michael Voltaggio’s sous chef at the restaurant
Ink in Los Angeles, shared with us his recipe for a Dutch Baby modeled
after one from his childhood. “My mother was a single mom raising
three kids,” he says. “She made Dutch babies because they were
affordable, and always made us feel special. Today, they’re something
we all associate with special occasions and happy times.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Dutch baby is a cross between a soufflé and an omelette. It is
oven-baked in a hot fry pan rather than cooked on the stovetop,
ensuring a light, fluffy rise with a deliciously crisp
edge. Dickinson’s version is topped with a bacon-maple syrup and
dollop of whipped cream.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
  <li>
    <p>4 Tbs. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</p>
  </li>
  <li>confectioner’s sugar for dusting</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Put an 11-inch French skillet or ovenproof sauté pan in a cold oven. Preheat the oven to 475&amp;degF;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the eggs, flour, milk and vanilla in a blender. Blend on high until frothy, about 30 seconds, stopping the blender to scrape down the sides as needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the oven is heated, put the <strong>butter</strong> in the hot skillet. Return it to the oven until the butter melts and browns, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carefully pour the <strong>batter</strong> into the hot skillet. Bake until the Dutch baby is lightly browned and the sides have risen, 17 to 19 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove the skillet from the oven and let the Dutch baby cool for 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cut the Dutch baby into wedges and dust with confectioners’ sugar. Serve immediately.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original recipe calls for heavy cream and confectioner’s sugar
to make whipped cream. Not really part of the recipe proper, but
whipped cream is a nice thing to have on the dutch baby.</p>

<p>The recipe also called for bacon and a maple syrup reduction. Omitted
this as well as being a bit <em>trop</em>.</p>

<p>Putting a squeeze of lemon juice on the serving and dusting with
confectioner’s sugar is the usual way I eat these.</p>
