    <p>It isn’t hard to make good pasta, but it does take more than just throwing noodles in a pot and running them over heat.</p>

<p>Pasta is one of those great foods/ingredients that is easy to make
well, and also easy to make horribly. This should help you in making
perfect pasta.</p>

<h2 id="different-pasta-takes-different-time-to-cook">Different pasta takes different time to cook</h2>

<p>This is fundamental: some pasta cooks a lot faster than other pasta.</p>

<p>Fresh pasta always cooks a lot faster than dry pasta. It only takes a
couple of minutes for fresh pasta to be ready, whereas most dry pasta
takes about 8-10 minutes to cook to the right consistency. Fresh pasta
will never really acquire that <em>al dente</em> (to the tooth) texture most
people associate with well-cooked pasta, but will still be a wonderful
texture and flavour if cooked correctly.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing about cooking pasta is timing it with the
other parts of your meal. You have to take into account the time it
takes to get the water to a rolling boil, then the amount of time to
cook the pasta to the proper consistency. Many a pasta dish has been
ruined by preparing the pasta too soon and either letting it sit in
it’s cooking water or draining it and letting it sit in the pot
dry. You don’t want to do either of those things. A good rule of thumb
is that it takes about 5 minutes for a quart of water to reach a
rolling boil, but you should really time this for yourself on your own
stove, as some stoves work differntly than others. (Simple fact: gas
stoves can be hotter than electric stoves, provided the gas stove is
in good condition.)</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-the-perfect-pasta">Steps to the perfect pasta</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For every 2 ounces of (dry) pasta to be cooked, you want a pint of water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the water on the heat, cover, bring to a rolling boil. This is where the water is actively rolling over, not over-flowing the pot. If you cover the pot, it will boil more quickly. (In fact, the more you can seal the pot, the faster it will get there. Simple physics.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the pasta in the water, add a 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. This is to keep the starch from causing the pot to boil over. Put the lid back on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep the pasta going, covered, in the rolling boil for 6 minutes. You want a rolling boil so the pasta does not stick to the bottom. If you’re paranoid about it, think of giving the pasta a stir from time to time to make sure it doesn’t clump up or get stuck to the bottom. If you’ve used enough water, added the oil, and keep the water rolling, this should not be a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test the pasta to see if it is the consistency you desire it (slightly underdone is <em>al dente</em> - or “to the tooth” – which is the consistency most people prefer it.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it isn’t done yet, give it a couple more minutes and test again. (Some people advocate throwing a piece against the wall to see if it sticks. This is just messy and rude, and besides, if it did stick, it’s overdone.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the done pasta off the heat and drain in a collandar or seive. Make sure to let it drain thoroughly. Serve immediately.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Pasta is gluey and gloppy: this is pasta that has been left to sit in
it’s water after cooking. This is why you drain it and serve it
immediately.</p>

<p>Pasta is mushy: this is pasta that has been overcooked. Suitable only
for nursing homes – the staff, not the patients!</p>

<p>Pasta is crunchy: ok, this is underdone, or you didn’t use enough
water to begin with. Pasta needs a lot of water to cook well, don’t be
stingy. The last thing you really want is for your pot to run dry
while it’s cooking.</p>

<h2 id="cooking-times">Cooking times</h2>

<p>Pasta varies in cooking time depending on a lot of things: it’s size,
it’s shape, it’s density, it’s freshness. Fresh pasta cooks the
fastest, only 1 or 2 minutes under a rolling boil.</p>

<p><strong>Spaghetti</strong>, <strong>vermicelli</strong>, <strong>macaroni</strong>, <strong>lasagne</strong>, <strong>bow-tie</strong>,
<strong>spiral</strong>, and various other shapes take between 6 and 10 minutes
to cook. Check them at 6 minutes on the rolling boil to see if they
are done to the consistency you like them.</p>

<p><strong>Tortellini</strong> and <strong>raviola</strong> pasta are interesting to cook. Whether
fresh or dry, the way you tell when they are done is that they will
float to the top of the pot. Again, it is important to start with
enough water.</p>

<p>Small <strong>ring pasta</strong> takes only about 5-6 minutes to cook. I use this
pasta most often in salads, and as soon as it is done cooking, I drain
it and plunge it into cold water (usually under a cold tap) for
several minutes to stop the cooking process completely and make it
suitable for going in a cold salad.</p>

<p><strong>Shells</strong> and other such more constructed pasta can take 8-12 minutes
to cook. Small shells tend to cook a bit faster, like regular pasta.</p>

<p>Fresh <strong>gnocchi</strong> (the only way to have it) takes about 4 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Orzo</strong> (rice pasta) takes about 6 minutes or so to cook.</p>

<p><strong>Couscous</strong> (tiny grains of semolina pasta) requires a completely
different method of cooking. First, you match the amount of water
you are going to use with how much couscous you are going to
use. (Couscous packages typically have the right proportions.) You
bring the water to a boil, toss in the couscous, stir, and pull it
off the heat immediately and let it steep for 5 minutes. Include
golden raisins and pine nuts for a truly authentic dish! (Note: if
you add golden raisins, increase the water slightly to accomodate
for their absorbsion.)</p>
