    <p>From the half-baked harvest blog, these “burgers” and onion rings look
like they’d be super delicious, and probably a lot healthier than the
standard fast-food sort.</p>

<p>Go see the <a href="http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-chili-burgers-wbaked-cheddar-beer-onion-rings-fried-egg/">blog post</a> as it has some <em>super</em>
pictures of the food, and great commentary about it too!</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<h3 id="burgers">Burgers</h3>

<p>1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa</p>

<p>1 cup mashed sweet potatoes (about 1 medium sweet potato)</p>

<p>1/2 cup black beans, finely mashed</p>

<p>1 tablespoons tomato paste</p>

<p>1 large egg, lightly beaten</p>

<p>2 teaspoons chili powder</p>

<p>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</p>

<p>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</p>

<p>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>

<p>1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper</p>

<p>2 teaspoons brown sugar</p>

<p>1 teaspoon worchestire sauce</p>

<p>1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, plus more for topping</p>

<p>4 of your favorite burger buns, toasted (optional, try eating these atop
lettuce!)</p>

<p>4 fried eggs, optional… but not really</p>

<h3 id="baked-cheddar-beer-onion-rings">Baked Cheddar Beer Onion Rings</h3>

<p>2 large sweet onions, cut into 1/2 inch slices</p>

<p>1/2 cup buttermilk</p>

<p>1/2 cup of your favorite beer (I used pumpkin beer)</p>

<p>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</p>

<p>1/2 cup whole wheat flour</p>

<p>1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese crackers, finely crushed (gold fish or cheez
it’s)</p>

<p>1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs</p>

<p>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</p>

<p>1 teaspoon salt + 1/2 teaspoon pepper</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In a bowl combine the quinoa, mashed sweet potatoes, mashed black
beans, tomato paste, egg, chili powder, smoked paprika, cinnamon,
cayenne, salt, pepper, brown sugar and worchestire. Mix well to
moisten the ingredients and then mix in the shredded cheddar cheese.
Mix well again and form into 4 or 5 equal burger patties (I made 4).
The mixture will be very wet and sticky, this is fine, just make
rough circles. Place on a plate lined with wax paper and place in
the fridge while you prepare the onion rings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with
parchment paper or a silpat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the onion rings, whisk together the flour, buttermilk, beer
and dijon mustard in medium size mixing bowl. In another shallow
bowl, mix together the cheddar cheese cracker crumbs, Panko bread
crumbs, smoked paprika, salt and pepper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now take the slices of onion and dip them through the
buttermilk/beer mixture, making sure they are completely covered in
batter. Using your other clean hand, dredge the onion ring through
the cheddar crumbs, coating completely. Place on the prepared baking
sheet and repeat with the remaining onion slices. Once you have
coated all the onions slices, lightly spray them with olive oil or
cooking spray.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until coating is crisp, flipping half
way through. Season with salt, to taste.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the onion rings are baking, cook the burgers. Heat a large
skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Remove
patties from the fridge and place in the hot skillet. They will be
moist and sticky. Cook for 5-6 minutes, then if needed add more oil
and flip the burgers very gently (be gentle, they crumble easily
when hot). Cook for another 5-6 minutes. It is important to not flip
the burgers until they are ready. During the last minute or so of
cooking add some cheddar cheese to the top of each burger, cover the
pan and cook 2-3 minutes or until the cheese has melted. My burgers
were a little moist and very delicate, if they break on you, just
put them back together the best you can. Once you remove them from
the skillet and they cool slightly, they will firm up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To assemble the burgers, place each burger on a bun (or lettuce),
top with an egg and a few onion rings.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
