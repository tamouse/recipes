    <p>Carb Pie starts with potatoes! Potatoes are peeled and sliced in thin,
but not totally paper thin rounds. Olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning are
applied liberally.</p>

<p>We roast the potatoes before they’re placed in the galette. The
potatoes are piled too high and sliced too thick to bake in the time
that it takes the crust to bake. The cook times are imbalanced so we
balance the whole deal with a bit of pre-roasting.</p>

<p>makes one 8-inch galette</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<h3 id="for-the-crust">For the Crust:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
  <li>scant 1/3 cup cold buttermilk</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-the-filling">For the Filling:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>2 medium russet potatoes, mostly peeled and sliced into 1/4” rounds</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 to 2 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning</li>
  <li>1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
  <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<h3 id="crust">crust:</h3>

<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar and salt. Add cold, cubed
butter and, using your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture.
Quickly break the butter down into the flour mixture. Some butter pieces
will be the size of oat flakes; some will be the size of peas.</p>

<p>Create a
well in the mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk. Use a fork to bring
the dough together. Try to moisten all of the flour bits.</p>

<p>(Note: you can use a food processor for these steps.)</p>

<p>On a lightly
floured work surface, dump out the dough mixture. It will be moist and
shaggy. That’s perfect. Just gather it together into a disk. Wrap the
disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Allowing the dough to
rest in the refrigerator will help re-chill the butter and distribute
the moisture.</p>

<h3 id="filling">filling:</h3>

<p>Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 375
degrees F.</p>

<p>Use a bit of the olive to grease a rimmed baking pan.</p>

<p>Place potato rounds on the baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.</p>

<p>Generously sprinkle on Old Bay Seasoning.</p>

<p>Toss to coat all of the potato slices in
oil and seasoning.</p>

<p>Try to keep the potato in a single layer. If they
overlap a bit, that’s fine too.</p>

<p>Bake until mostly soft through, about 15
minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool just slightly.</p>

<h3 id="assembly">assembly</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, beat the egg and set aside.</p>

<p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</p>

<p>On a well-floured surface, roll one of the disks out to a
1/4”-thickness. It’s ok if some edges of the pie crust are wider than
the other. The crust doesn’t have to be perfectly round. We can trim it!</p>

<p>Transfer the dough to the center of the prepared baking sheet.</p>

<p>Lightly brush the center of the crust with egg. Add a layer of cooked
potato slices to the center of the pie crust, leaving about 2-inches of
pie crust surrounding on all sides. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese and
chives. Add another generous layer of potato slices and a bit more
cheese and chives. Add any remaining potato slices and top with a bit
more cheese and chives.</p>

<p>Trim any overly large edges from the pie crust, leaving about 1
1/2-inches on all sides. Brush the edges with egg wash. Gently fold the
crust up against the potato mountain and press gently to seal the edges.
Brush the outside of the pie crust with egg wash.</p>

<p>Bake until golden brown and bubbling, about 15 minutes. Remove from the
oven and serve warm. Add an egg and it’s totally breakfast.</p>
