    <p>Fragrant cinnamon, oregano and thyme lend an exotic touch to this
baked pasta dish. I often make it with ground lamb, although beef is a
satisfying substitute. It can be made almost entirely ahead and serves
a crowd — two things that make entertaining family and friends easy
and enjoyable. From Meredith Deeds.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
  <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped <em>(used 2)</em></li>
  <li>3 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced <em>(used 2 tablespoons bottled
crushed garlic)</em></li>
  <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 to 1 1/2 lb. lean ground lamb or beef, or a combination of both</li>
  <li>1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes, with juices <em>(used 2 15-oz cans)</em></li>
  <li>2 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp. dried thyme</li>
  <li>Pinch of cayenne</li>
  <li><em>(Dash of smoked paprika)</em></li>
  <li>1 lb. elbow or penne pasta</li>
  <li>1 c. (2 percent) milk</li>
  <li>1 c. low-fat Greek yogurt</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>3/4 c. finely grated Parmesan, divided</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Heat the oven to 375 degrees and arrange a rack in the middle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the sauce, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add the onion and garlic, and season with salt and freshly
ground black pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
the onions are soft, about 6 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the meat and break up any large clumps with the back of a
wooden spoon. Cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5
minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, cinnamon, oregano and thyme, and
cook until slightly thickened, about 5 to 10 minutes more, then
remove from the heat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meanwhile (<em>ahem</em>: If your stove is as slow as <em>mine</em> is, start the
water going <em>right away</em>. It takes 4 quarts of water to cook a
pound of elbow macaroni), bring a large pot of heavily salted water
to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook pasta to not quite al
dente (you want to undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook
in the oven). When pasta is done, add to the sauce and toss to
coat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pour the pasta into a large baking dish. (The pasta can be made
ahead until this point, covered with foil and frozen for up to 3
weeks. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and proceed with the
recipe, adding 10 to 15 minutes more to the cooking time.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, yogurt, eggs and 1/2 cup
of the Parmesan cheese until evenly combined. Slowly pour it over
the entire dish; the liquid should completely cover the
noodles. Sprinkle the top with remaining cheese. Cover with foil
and bake until bubbly, about 40 to 45 minutes. Uncover and bake
until bubbling and browned, about 10 to 15 minutes more. Let sit
for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
