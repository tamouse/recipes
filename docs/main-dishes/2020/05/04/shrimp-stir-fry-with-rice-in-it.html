    <p>Made this a couple of night ago, yet another of what my sister calls “Stuff with Stuff In It” :D</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<p>In order of appearance, mainly, but you want to spend a bit of time prepping and getting everything together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
  <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
  <li>half a left-over bag of brussels sprouts (about 10 or so on the smaller side), diced up</li>
  <li>a double handful of cole slaw mix (green and red cabbage, julliened carrots), chop it up a bit so there aren’t any massive bits of cabbage heart</li>
  <li>another 1/2 cup or so of left-over shredded carrots</li>
  <li>a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
  <li>a heaping tablespoon of crushed ginger</li>
  <li>1 microwave pouch of brown and wild rice (you <strong>have</strong> to check these for allergens when you’re shopping!)</li>
  <li>chinese five spice powder</li>
  <li>curry powder</li>
  <li>black pepper</li>
  <li>seasoned salt</li>
  <li>tamari or braggs</li>
  <li>sesame oil</li>
  <li>rice vinegar</li>
  <li>a tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
  <li>a tiny bit of thai chili garlic paste (how much you use is entirely your business)</li>
  <li>about 20 frozen shrimp, shelled and deveined, but not yet cooked</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>heat up a big skillet, put a little oil in it, use whatever you like</li>
  <li>dump the onion, celery, sprouts, cole slaw mix, and carrots in the pan, and give it a good 4-5 minutes to get going, stirring it up occasionally</li>
  <li>add the garlic and ginger, get that going well</li>
  <li>add the dry spices and mix them in well</li>
  <li>add the tamari, sesame oil, rice vinegar, tomato paste, and chili paste, mix that in well</li>
  <li>cook the rice while letting the pan stuff continue to meld</li>
  <li>give the frozen shrimp a minute or two in the microwave to get the ice off, drain</li>
  <li>make a little space for the shrimp in the pan, put them in cook, covering with the rest of the ingredients</li>
  <li>after a couple minutes, turn the shrimps so they cook on both sides</li>
  <li>dump in the rice and mix everything together</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>I prepped all the veggies up to the carrots and just dumped them in a big bowl. After the pan and oil were hot enough, I dumped the bowl right in. I’ve made the mistake of starting cooking some of the ingredients while still prepping the others, and that ended up not so well. Also pull out all the dry and wet spices so you have those ready to go.</p>

<p>I don’t have measures for the seasoning, because that’s really your business. I never measure, just put in enough until it looks good. I may have put in a bit too much 5 spice, but I’m okay with that.</p>

<p>Stir fries don’t take constant attention in my experience when you’re cooking on a standard stove in a standard skillet. If you have a wok and a high flame, you have to pay a lot more attention to them.</p>

<p>On the 90-second rice pouches: I use these a lot, but one has to read labels on them. Sometimes they include soy, wheat, milk, nuts, and so on. If you’re good, you can make your own rice and stand in the light of your own righteous cooking skills. You can also do cauliflower rice, or quinoa, or even pasta. I’m not the boss of you.</p>

<p>This feeds me for three meals easily. I mean, if you had to do four, you’d still be getting a big bowl of goodness.</p>
