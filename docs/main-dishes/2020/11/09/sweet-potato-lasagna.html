  <h3>Direcctions</h3>
  <ol>
    
    <li>Arrange racks in oven so you can cook two trays of sweet potato slices</li>
    
    <li>Heat oven to 400&deg;F</li>
    
    <li>Prepare peeled sweet potatoes by slicing them thinly, for example with a mandolin. I sliced them into rounds, but you could slice them the long way, too</li>
    
    <li>Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper</li>
    
    <li>Arrange the slices in a single layer on each pan</li>
    
    <li>Put both pans in, one on each rack</li>
    
    <li>Cook for about 15 minutes</li>
    
    <li>I had some slices that didn't fit, so I steamed them in the microwave instead; it's all good</li>
    
    <li>When they're done, set them aside to cool</li>
    
    <li>In a medium fry pan on medium heat, add oil or butter to melt</li>
    
    <li>When the oil is hot, add the onions and mushrooms, let cook until starting to turn translucent</li>
    
    <li>Add the garlic and continue to cook for a couple minutes</li>
    
    <li>Remove the mixture from the pan and set aside</li>
    
    <li>Add the ground turkey to the same pan and cook thoroughly, crumbling in to small bits. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    
    <li>When cooked, add in the onion, garlic and mushrooms and mix thoroughly</li>
    
    <li>Add a cup of the marinara to the meat mixture and combine well</li>
    
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the toffuti, nooch it, and a couple ounces of the mozzarella. You may want to add some nutritional yeast, I did not here.</li>
    
    <li>In a 9x13 pan, put a layer of marinara on the bottom, a layer of sweet potatoes, then a layer of meat, and some blobs of the cheese mixture, ending with sprinkling some more mozzarella</li>
    
    <li>Repeat with the next layer</li>
    
    <li>End with the top layer of sweet potato, and the rest of the marinara sauce</li>
    
    <li>Sprinkly more mozzarella on top</li>
    
    <li>Bake at 400&deg;F for 30 minutes</li>
    
    <li>Remove and let rest for 10 minutes</li>
    
  </ol>
  

  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  
  <p><p>Okay, this is pretty lightly flavoured, I had a lot more garlic in mine, “but that’s my business”</p>
</p>
  
  <p><p>If you are using jarred marinara sauce, you will probably want to add a lot more spices to it such as more oregano and basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, etc. You do you.</p>
</p>
  
  <p><p>This should make 8 servings, but it was so good I had 1 and a half servings, so plan accordingly. I ended up with 3 servings in the freezer and one in the fridge for the next day, plus a half serving I ate for breakfast the next day.</p>
