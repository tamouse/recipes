    <p>Made this today for Memrorial Weekend celebration BBQ at my brother’s. I needed something to bring that I know I’d be able to eat and enjoy. Learning to find things I can eat while being out with normal folks is hard. This one, though, is AMAZING. This is pretty similar to <a href="/recipes/recipes/salads/2016/06/24/sweet-and-white-potato-salad.html">Sweet and White Potato Salad</a> except the taters are baked intead of boiled. Plus BACON.</p>

<p>Make it vegetarian / vegan by taking out the eggs, bacon, and using a vegan mayo instead.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>2 white potatoes (I used standard bakers)</li>
  <li>1 sweet potato</li>
</ul>

<p>The point here is to get 2:1 ratio on the white vs. sweet. The sweet potatoes I saw at the market really outclassed most of the bakers, so I had to select carefully.</p>

<p>Also, if you prefer yams, go for it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 eggs (I used Jumbo, and that’s not too much egg for this)</li>
  <li>1 pound bacon</li>
  <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
  <li>1 cup onion, chopped</li>
  <li>mayo of your choice (the family favourite is Miracle Whip)</li>
  <li>mustard (yellow works well)</li>
  <li>sweet pickle relish</li>
  <li>paprika</li>
  <li>salt &amp; pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Heat up the oven to 450° F</li>
  <li>Wash the taters, and wrap them in foil</li>
  <li>Bake them taters for 40 minutes at 450. (I put them on a sheet to make handling them a little easier.)</li>
  <li>Go have a lie down.</li>
  <li>Take the taters out.</li>
  <li>Fry up the pound of bacon. Drain it well.</li>
  <li>Another lie down.</li>
  <li>Dice the white taters and toss in a big bowl. Peel the sweet tater, dice it and toss that in a big bowl.</li>
  <li>If the bacon is dry, chop that and toss that in the bowl.</li>
  <li>Put the 4 eggs in a pot, add water to cover, and bring to boil. Turn down to a steady roll and cook for 20 minutes or so to get hard.</li>
  <li>You can’t have a lie down while you have stuff on the stove so go sit at the table and play on your iPad or something.</li>
  <li>Take the eggs off the heat, drain them and soak in cold water.</li>
  <li>Now you can have another lie down.</li>
  <li>Chop up the celery and onion if you haven’t already, toss it in the big mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>I think another lie down is in order.</li>
  <li>Peel the eggs, run them through an egg slicer twice and toss in the bowl.</li>
  <li>After you’ve recovered from that, here’s where it gets weird…</li>
  <li>Since you bought your mustard in a squeezy bottle, squeeze a bunch into the mixing bowl. A little more. Yeah, I know it hurts.</li>
  <li>Smart you bought your mayo in jar, so take two heaping glops of it into mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Dust in a bunch of paprika. I used a small spoon which I think is about a teaspoon.</li>
  <li>Dump in some sweet pickle relish. I think it was maybe a 1/4 cup? Might be too much, I don’t know I’m not the boss of you.</li>
  <li>Lots of pepper and some salt.</li>
  <li>Whomp that mess together, but not violently. Keep turning the mixing bowl in your hand while you use the mixing spoon that you measured out the mayo with to keep turning the pile over from bottom outside into the center. Try not to have that slip in your hand and fling things out of the bowl.</li>
  <li>Taste it and die of pleasure.</li>
  <li>Fridge it. This is going in overnight because I was smart enough not to try to rush this before going down tomorrow.</li>
  <li>Try not to go back and keep tasting it. Yeah, right.</li>
</ol>
