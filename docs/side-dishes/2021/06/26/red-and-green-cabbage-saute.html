<p>As made, this recipe needs some help.</p>

<h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h1>

<ul>
  <li>olive oil</li>
  <li>vegan butter</li>
  <li>medium onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>8 oz mushrooms, sliced (NOT FROZEN, PRECOOKED 🤮)</li>
  <li>red cabbage, chopped (I don’t know how much it was)</li>
  <li>green cabbage, chopped (I don’t know how much it was, equal to red cabbage)</li>
  <li>(leftover kale, chopped — totally optional, i just had some)</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>pepper</li>
  <li>ground caraway seeds, maybe some whole ones</li>
  <li>rice vinegar (I don’t know how much I used, maybe a couple ounces. I could use apple cider vinegar, too)</li>
  <li>2 Tablespoons tamari (I didn’t actually measure this)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="directions">Directions</h1>

<p>Before starting, make sure you have all the ingredients prepped and ready; Notably, if you’re serving a protein with this, make sure it is ready to go.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> keep an eye on the cabbage, don’t let it get too soft, soggy, or skunky; make sure it doesn’t overcook.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put a large sauté pan on high heat (7-ish). When the pan is hot, add about a half tablespoon of oil. As the oil warms up, add a knob of butter to melt. Season the oil with salt, pepper, caraway seasonings, let the butter melt.</li>
  <li>Add the onions to the pan, let them cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the mushrooms and the garlic, mix them around and let them cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the cabbage (and kale) to the pan, and let it cook for a minute or so, undisturbed.</li>
  <li>After a minute or so, add the vinegar and tamari.</li>
  <li>Start to stir the cabbage down, as it gets cooked and releases water. Leave it sit, with occasional stirring to make sure all of it coated with oil, butter, and spices. Taste it and add more seasonings if needed.</li>
  <li>Make sure NOT to cook it too long, leave the cabbage crunchy. (If it gets skunky smelling and/or soggy, you’ve gone too far)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>The cabbage sauté didn’t have the right seasonings. I did add more salt at the end, and more ground pepper, but that wasn’t enough. It needed something to impart more flavour. I could barely taste the caraway. At the table, I added some Everything But The Bagel seasoning; that gave it something to aspire to, anyway.</p>

<p>I served this with some frozen teriyaki chicken thighs, and also screwed that part up. I should have had the protein prepped before the cabbage and it would have tasted better. Nothing tastes quite as awful as microwaved, precooked, frozen chicken.</p>

<p>My other major cooking faux pas was using frozen portobello mushrooms. That was just a huge mistake. I did toss them in the pan to sauté with the onions, but they unmistakably tasted like they had been frozen. Much better to just use fresh.</p>

<p>As I sit here typing this up, half the meal is still sitting on the plate, and an additional half the cabbage alone is in the pan on the stove cooling off.</p>
