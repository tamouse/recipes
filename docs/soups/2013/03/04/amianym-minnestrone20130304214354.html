    <p>From an online friend.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is cook some navy beans and kidney beans in a roughly equal ratio. You should get them mostly done, but still somewhat crunchy, as they’ll cook further in the soup. I do them for 15 minutes in my pressure cooker. Or, you can use canned beans.</p>

<p>Then, you need to chop as much red or yellow onion as you want. You also need to peel carrots, quarter them, and chop those. You can add celery too, but I usually skip it because I don’t use it up quickly. It also requires a good quantity of coarsely minced garlic; tonight I used a whole head.</p>

<p>Start frying the onion on low heat in a good quantity of oil. When it’s gone soft, add the carrots and celery. When the onion is starting to brown slightly at the edges, add the garlic.</p>

<p>To that, add:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beans</li>
  <li>1 32-ounce can diced or stewed tomatoes</li>
  <li>
    <p>8 cups stock or equivalent amount of water + bouillon (note: it’s best if you don’t go for straight chicken stock; something with a darker, browned flavor is nice. This could mean a bit of beef stock or vegetable stock; tonight I used a mix of cheap gross chicken bouillon granules and the dregs of a jar of vegetable Better than Bouillon.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Rosemary</li>
  <li>Bay leaves</li>
  <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring everything to a boil, reduce the heat, and cover (It should simmer gently.) Cook for, I dunno, 45 minutes? Or however long you think the carrots and the beans need. You can really let it go or rush through this stage and it’s not really deleterious to the result.</p>

<p>Add green beans. Fresh is nicest, I always use frozen, and canned is mushy. You can also add a zucchini if you’d like. That will need to cook for about 20 minutes; it’s best if the veggies stay a little bit crisp. Also add any combination of thyme, basil, and oregano. (Fresh herbs are awesome, of course.) Separately, boil salted water for pasta. I like medium shells. Leave the pasta chewy; it cooks more in the soup. You want to be more careful of your timing here; I feel like the veggies being crisp or not makes a big difference in the overall impression the finished soup makes. When your veggies and pasta are done, stop everything and add a good pile of black pepper. (Pepper gets bitter when it’s cooked.) Om nom nom.</p>
