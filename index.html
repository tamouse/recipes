  <h1>Recipe File</h1>

  <p>
    Way back when, I had a paper notebook that I used to write all my
    recipes down in. At one point I thought for sure I had lost it,
    but <strong>no! </strong> my lovely sister found it while we were pawing
    through boxes in my storage lockers.
  </p>

    Nevertheless, I had started this file several years ago on old
    wiki, and brought them over here in Jekyll and Bootstrap to update
    them and add to them.
