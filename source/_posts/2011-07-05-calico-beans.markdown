* 2 tablespoons vinegar
* 1 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1 16 ounce can baked beans (original was editted to be 28 oz can)
* 1 16 ounce can red kidney beans
* 1 16 ounce can lima or butter beans


## Directions

1. heat oven to 350&deg;F
2. chop up the bacon into small pieces, fry in a pan, drain on paper towels and crumble
3. pour off the fat and brown the ground beef in the same pan, breaking up the meat as it cooks, drain off fat
4. in a large casserole dish, combine the beef, bacon, onions, ketchup, brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt, vinegar, mustard, and beans
