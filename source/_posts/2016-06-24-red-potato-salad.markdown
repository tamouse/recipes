Another bog-standard potato salad recipe using skin-on red potatoes
for a large group.

## Ingredients

* 3 pounds unpeeled red potatoes
* 4 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
* 1/2 cup sliced green onions
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 cup sliced celery

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add red potatoes, and
   cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and
   chop into 1 inch cubes. Place in a medium bowl.

1. Place eggs in a medium saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring
   water to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let
   eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot
   water, cool, peel and dice.

1. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, milk, distilled white
   vinegar, green onions, salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the
   potatoes, and mix together with the eggs and celery. Cover, and
   chill in the refrigerator approximately 2 hours before serving.
