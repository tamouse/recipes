From the webiste: "Instant Pot Shredded Chicken Burrito Bowl is the most delicious Burrito you will ever eat. One pot cooking in your instant pot and it takes less than 20 minutes to prepare."

## Notes

  * Prep Time: 4 min 
  * Cook Time: 8 min 
  * Serves: 4 to 8

## Ingredients

(Half of original, feels better for 1 person, even with saving.)

  * 1 1/2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (using chicken thighs, boneless, skinless, figuring 1 breast = 2 thighs)
  * 1 1‚ÅÑ8 cups of chicken broth
  * 1/2 pack of taco seasoning
  * 1/2 can of sweet corn, drained
  * 1/2 can of black beans, rinsed and drained
  * 1/2 can of Rotel (tomatoes, small dice, seasoned okay)
  * 1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced (left out)
  * 1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced (left out)
  * 1/2 medium onion, sliced
  * 1 cups of long grain rice


## Preparation Steps

1. In the Instant Pot, pour just enough chicken broth to cover the bottom of the pot. 
2. Then place the chicken breasts along the bottom of the pot. 
3. Sprinkle the taco seasoning evenly over the chicken.
4. Pour the corn, black beans, and tomatoes into the pot. Try to pour them in different sections of the pot, so everything doesn't pile up in one place.
5. Add both the green and red bell peppers (omitted), and the onion. Again, spreading them evenly along the top, so they don't pile up too much.
6. Add the rice evenly to the pot. Then add the remaining chicken broth. Try to push the rice down so that it's covered by the broth.
7. Using your Instant Pot's instructions, pressure cook for 8 minutes. 
8. Once it's done cooking, allow it to slowly depressurize for 10 minutes. 
9. Then release the sealing valve to vent any remaining pressure.
10. Remove the lid. Using 2 forks pull the chicken meat apart so it becomes thin enough for a good taco consistency. (This feels a little dangerous in terms of heat. Might remove the chicken pieces to a bowl to do the shredding, then add back. Put the lid back on and seal it while shredding the chicken outside the bowl.)
11. Stir well to incorporate all the ingredients and place the lid back on. 
12. Do not turn the Instant Pot on, but let it sit with the lid sealed for at least 5 minutes. This will finish cooking any rice that may have been sitting on the top and not cooked all the way through.
13. Enjoy in a bowl by itself, in a soft tortilla, or with tortilla chips. And don't forget your favorite toppings!
