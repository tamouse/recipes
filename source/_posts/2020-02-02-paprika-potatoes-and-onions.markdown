Potatoes are a common appetizer in Spain, in small plates known as tapas, often served with garlic aioli sauce or spicy bravas sauce. Potatoes can also be found in a tortilla, a Spanish version of an omelet, with sweet onions. I love the flavors of garlic and paprika from the aioli and bravas sauces. Potatoes with onions are another winning combination. Combining all of these elements makes for a delicious dish. Paprika potatoes with onions are perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

From Gluten-Free Living magazine, Naturally Gluten-Free, "Welcome to a world of flavor" by Jennifer Fitzpatrick, March/April 2020 issue.

## Ingredients

 * 1 pound multi-color or rainbow fingerling potatoes, cut into large chunks or quartered
 * 1 Spanish onion
 * 2 tablespoon olive oil
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
 * 1 tablespoon paprika
 * Sea salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 &deg; F. 
2. Line two baking sheets or jelly roll pans with foil or a silicone baking mat.
3. Peel and cut the onion into large chunks, making sure both the potatoes and onions are roughly the same size. This will allow them to cook evenly.
4. Place the onions and potatoes into a bowl. 
5. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, and use your hands to make sure the oil is coated on all the potato and onion pieces. 
6. Add the garlic powder, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. 
7. Toss again and pour onto baking sheet, distributing evenly and leaving space.
8. Roast the potato and onion mixture in the oven for 10-12 minutes. 
9. Remove and use a spatula to move the mixture around. 
10. Coat again with another tablespoon of olive oil, toss and return to oven for an additional 10-12 minutes.
11. Remove potatoes and onions or bake until desired crispness.
