I whipped this up pretty fast without looking anything up. It came out great with tons of leftovers.

## Ingredients ##

  * 1 medium onion, chopped
  * 2 Tbsp olive oil
  * 6-8 boneless skinless chicken thighs, thawed
  * seasoned salt
  * black pepper
  * big pinch for each side: Raj al Hanout seasoning
  * 1 cup water
  * 12 oz jar Patek's Curry Simmer Sauce
  * 1 cup rice

## Directions ##

1. peel and chop the onion, mince the garlic
2. set IP to sauté. when hot, add the oil
3. when the oil is hot, start sautéing the onions and garlic
4. season one side of the thighs generously
5. when onions are starting to turn translucent, push to the side, and lay the chicken in, seasoned side down
6. season the up side of the chicken generously
7. after 3 minutes, flip the chicken, and cook for another 3 minutes
8. remove all the chicken and onions, set aside
9. add 1 cup water to the pot, and set the trivet in
10. layer the chicken and onions on the trivet
11. pour over the jar of curry sauce
12. pour the rice over the top evenly, and press in to make sure nothing is high and dry
13. set the IP to Pressure cook for 20 minutes
14. when the pressure cycle is done, let natural release go for another 10-15 minutes
15. release the pressure, make sure everything is off, and pop the top
16. if it's too watery, remove the meat as best you can, and sauté the rice and sauce to reduce the liquid, stirring constantly
17. shred the chicken so it's in nice bite-sized pieces; don't go too far
18. when it's to your desired thickness, add the meat back and give everything a good stir, and it's ready to serve
