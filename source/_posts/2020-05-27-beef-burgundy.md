Beef Bourguignon (or “Beef Burgundy”) is my favorite thing to cook in my Instant Pot. It’s aromatic and filling and is a great meal to make for company or to serve on a cold autumn or winter night.



## Ingredients ##

- 1 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 6 oz. Bacon, roughly chopped
- 3 lbs. Beef Chuck, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 1 bag of Baby Carrots
- 1 large White Onion, diced
- 6 cloves Garlic, minced (divided)
- 1 pinch coarse Salt & freshly ground Pepper
- 2 Tbsp. GF Flour
- 1 c. small Pearl Onions (frozen)
- 1 c. Red Wine (like Merlot, Pinot Noir, or a Chianti)
- 3 c. Beef Stock (I use Better Than Boullion)
- 2 Tbsp. Tomato Paste
- 1/2 tsp. Thyme
- 2 Tbsp. Parsley
- 2 Bay Leaves
- 1 lb. Baby Bella mushrooms
- 2 Tbsp. Vegan Butter

## Directions ##

1. Set Instant Pot to SAUTÉ function (or use a pan on the stove over medium heat). Sauté the bacon in 1 Tbsp of oil until crisp and browned. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
2. Pat dry the beef with paper towel; sear in batches until browned on all sides in the oil/bacon fat.
3. Return bacon to the pot. Season with ½ tsp coarse salt and ¼ tsp ground pepper. Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook on SAUTÉ for a further 4-5 minutes to brown.
4. Add in the onions, pearl onions, carrots, wine, beef stock, tomato paste, 4 cloves minced garlic and herbs. Stir well, cover and lock the lid into place. Press “Keep Warm/Cancel” to stop the Sauté function, then set to “MANUAL” mode. Choose “HIGH PRESSURE” for 30 minutes cook time.
5. After cooking, allow the pressure to release naturally for 8-10 minutes. Open the valve and allow and remaining steam to escape.
6. While steam is releasing, prepare your buttered mushrooms (OPTIONAL -- or you can add them straight in without cooking in butter if desired).
7. Heat the butter in a medium-sized skillet/pan over medium heat. Add the remaining 2 cloves garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds), then add in the mushrooms.
8. Cook for about 5 minutes, while shaking the pan occasionally to coat with the butter. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Set aside.
9. Change the Instant Pot setting back to the SAUTÉ setting. Stir well and allow the sauce to thicken uncovered, for a further 5-10 minutes.
10. Add the buttered mushrooms, garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes, rice or noodles.
