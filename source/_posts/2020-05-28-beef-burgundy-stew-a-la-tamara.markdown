## Notes

This isn't "officially" beuf burgongone as the French make it, this is my shot given what I have on hand at this moment.

I used marjoram since it's what I had. Thyme would probably be better.

The carrots are a little overdone, I might add them after 15 minutes instead of the whole 30.

OMG this is good tho!
