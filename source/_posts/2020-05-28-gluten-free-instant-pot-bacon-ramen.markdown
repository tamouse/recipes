Gluten-free ramen swimming in THE most flavorful bacon broth. (Yes, I said bacon broth.) Loaded with veggies, & super easy (even using frozen chicken!) this instant pot bacon ramen noodle comes together in 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 package of bacon, chopped
- 1 inch fresh ginger, minced finely or grated
- 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 5 cups chicken broth (or 5 cups water + 3 Tablespoons broth base)
- 2 Tablespoons gluten-free soy sauce*
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1 Tablespoon red curry paste
- 1 Tablespoon toasted sesame oil (optional, if no sesame allergy)
- 2 frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 squares of gluten-free noodles** (or about 5 oz.)
- 1 cups fresh baby spinach
- 1 cup peeled carrot
- green onions, chilies and cilantro, for serving


## Directions

1. Hit "saute" on your instant pot and place the chopped bacon inside the instant pot. Cook the bacon until crispy, and remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate, and leave the remaining grease inside the instant pot.
2. Add the diced ginger and mushrooms, and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 minutes, until the mushrooms are browned.
3. Turn off the "saute" function. Add in the five cups of broth, soy sauce, rice vinegar, red curry paste, sesame oil and chicken breasts.
4. Close the lid, move the valve to sealing and use the "manual" button until you reach 15 minutes (for raw chicken) and 27 minutes (for frozen chicken).
5. Once the timer is done, move the valve to venting to quickly release the pressure.
6. Open the lid and add in your noodles, carrots and spinach.
7. While the noodles soften in the hot liquid, remove your chicken and shred. Return the shredded chicken to the pot.
8. Ladle into bowls, and top with your desired garnishes and crisped bacon that you set aside from step 1.
