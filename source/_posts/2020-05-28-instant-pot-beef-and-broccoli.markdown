Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli - This comforting and hearty dish brings bold asian flavors that are Whole30, Paleo, Keto, Gluten Free and Soy Free. It's the perfect healthy 30 minute meal

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup coconut aminos
- 2 Tablespoons fish sauce (click for a whole30 approved fish sauce)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- (optional) 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 lb serloin beef tips or flank steak trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 Tablespoon avocado oil
- 1/2 cup beef broth
- 12 ounces broccoli florets
- sesame seeds and green onion to garnish

## Directions

1. Stir together the marinade in a large bowl or zip lock bag. Toss the beef in the marinade and let sit in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours up to overnight.
2. Pour the beef and marinade into the Instant Pot with the beef broth and avocado oil, stir together.
3. Lock the lid, set the steamer valve to sealing and select high pressure/manual for 10 minutes.
4. After the cooking has finished immediately quick release the steam. Once the pressure has released remove the lid and stir in the broccoli florets.
5. Place the lid back on the Instant Pot and lock for 5 minutes. (Do not set an additional cooking time, the residual heat will cook the broccoli. 5 minutes will yield broccoli that is still a bit aldente, for very soft broccoli let it stay in the Instant Pot for 10 minutes.)
6. (Optional) To thicken the sauce remove the beef and broccoli with a slotted spoon and set aside. Turn the Instant Pot to Sauté mode with the lid off and reduce the sauce for 10 minutes.
7. Once the sauce has reached the desired thickness stir the beef and broccoli back into the sauce to warm through.
8. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions and serve.
