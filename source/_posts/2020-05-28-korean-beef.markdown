This Korean Beef is the perfect hearty meat dish with lots of fresh ginger and garlic for a healthy and comforting slightly sweet dish without any added sugar! I can’t get enough!

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef flat iron steak, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 2 Tablespoons arrowroot powder (omit for Keto)
- 2 Tablespoon avocado oil
- 3/4 cup coconut aminos
- 3/4 cup water
- 8 garlic cloves, minced (or 1.5 tsp garlic powder)
- 1 Tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (this amount doesn’t result in a spicy dish but more can be added if desired)
- Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds

## Directions

1. (For Keto skip to step 2 since you won’t use arrowroot.) Add the cut beef to a gallon sized zip lock bag with 2 Tablespoons arrowroot powder, close the bag and shake until all the beef is coated.
2. In a mixing bowl or large measuring cup stir together the coconut aminos, water, minced garlic, grated ginger, apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper flakes.
3. Turn on the instant pot to the saute setting and add the avocado oil allowing it to heat up for 1-2 minutes.
4. Once the oil is hot, add the beef pieces and cook for 2 minutes then turn over the pieces using tongs and cook for another 2 minutes.
5. Pour the sauce mixture over the beef to deglaze the pot and scrape off any bits from the bottom of the pot.
6. Secure the instant pot lid, set the valve to sealing and cook on high pressure/manual for 10 minutes.
7. Once the cooking has completed allow the instant pot to depressurize for 10 minutes before quick releasing any remaining pressure and removing the lid.
8. Serve immediately over spaghetti squash, cauliflower rice, green beans, brussels sprouts, asparagus or broccoli. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds.
