No food is more beloved by Norwegians than potato lefse, thin pancakes made of potato and flour. This recipe uses gluten-free flour instead.

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds (about 3 large) russet potatoes
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- 3 tablespoons *(vegan?)* butter
- 1/4 cup heavy cream or whole milk *(almond milk? thicker?)*
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 to 3 cups gluten-free flour
- Garnish: *(vegan?)* butter and sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 175 F.
2. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. Place in a pot, add cold water until covered and bring to a boil. Cook until tender and drain. Spread cooked potatoes on a baking sheet in one layer and place in preheated oven for 15 minutes. (This helps remove moisture from the potatoes.)
3. Use a ricer to rice cooked potatoes into a large bowl. You should end up with about 4 cups of riced potatoes.
4. Place shortening, butter, cream or milk, sugar, and salt in a saucepan and heat over medium-low just until shortening and butter melt and sugar is dissolved. Don't let the mixture boil.
5. Pour this liquid over riced potatoes and use a large spoon or spatula to thoroughly combine ingredients. Potatoes should be smooth and thick.
6. Pack the potatoes in an airtight bowl and refrigerate overnight.
7. Preheat a 10-inch to 12-inch round stovetop griddle or an electric lefse griddle to 425 F.
8. Use your hands or a pastry blender to work the gluten-free flour gradually into chilled potatoes. Turn the lefse dough onto a large pastry cloth or board liberally dusted with all-purpose gluten-free flour. Knead in just enough gluten-free flour to form a smooth and pliable dough.
9. Using either your hands or an ice cream scoop, remove walnut-size pieces of dough. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out each piece into a 9-inch circle on the floured board.
10. Using a lefse stick, carefully lift the dough and quickly transfer to the griddle. Cook until brown spots begin to appear, then flip and grill the other side. Place lefse between clean cloths to cool, then serve with butter and sugar.
