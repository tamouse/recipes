> OP: "This recipe takes me right back to my childhood when my mom would freeze black bananas, which would have ended up in the trash otherwise, and once she had enough bananas stored up, she would whip up a batch of homemade banana bread. The taste, texture and smell of this Paleo Banana Bread is exactly what I remember, minus the gluten, grains and even eggs!"
