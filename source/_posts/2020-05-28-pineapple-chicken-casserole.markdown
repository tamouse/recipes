Not quite converted to DF / GF, but close. A pretty easy casserole. It will need something for the noodle crunch that is GF.

## Notes

- Prep Time: 10 min 
- Cook Time: 20 min 
- Serves: 4 servings

## Ingredients ##

- 2 cups cubed cooked chicken or 12oz canned chicken
- ~~1 can (10-1/2 ounces) condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted~~ 1 cup vegan white sauce
- 1 cup pineapple tidbits
- 2 celery ribs, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped green onion
- 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium ~~soy sauce~~ tamari
- ~~1 can (3 ounces) chow mein noodles, divided~~ I don't really have a sub for this yet.

## Directions ##

1. Preheat oven to 350°. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. 
3. Fold in 1 cup chow mein noodles. 
4. Transfer to a greased shallow 2-qt. baking dish.

7. If desired, top with additional green onions.
