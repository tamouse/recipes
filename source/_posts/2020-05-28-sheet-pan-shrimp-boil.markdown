Easiest shrimp boil ever! And it’s mess-free using a single sheet pan. That’s right. ONE PAN. No newspapers. No bags. No clean-up!

## Ingredients

- 1 pound baby Dutch yellow potatoes
- 3 ears corn, each cut crosswise into 6 pieces
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning
- 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 (12.8-ounce) package smoked andouille sausage, thinly sliced
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 
2. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray. 
3. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook potatoes until just tender and parboiled, about 10-13 minutes. 
4. Stir in corn during the last 5 minutes of cooking time; drain well. 
5. In a small bowl, combine butter, garlic and Old Bay seasoning. 
6. Place potatoes, corn, shrimp and sausage in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. 
7. Stir in butter mixture and gently toss to combine.
