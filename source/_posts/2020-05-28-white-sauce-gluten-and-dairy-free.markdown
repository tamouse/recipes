Finding wheat, dairy and sugar free recipes for my daughter is hard, but I adapted a white sauce recipe and made it slightly sweet for some flavour. She loves this sauce with anything, including salad!

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons gluten-free flour
- 2 tablespoons soy margarine
- 2 2/3 cups soymilk
- 2 tablespoons honey (more or less to taste)


## Directions

1. In a warm saucepan mix margarine and flour together, stirring quickly.
2. When combined and melted add milk slowly, stirring quickly.
3. Add honey.
4. Simmer whilst stirring and serve with wheat-free pasta, rice noodles, roast beef, potatoes or use in a lasagna.
5. I even use it instead of margarine on crackers with salmon or avacado.

## Notes

* Cooking time: 10 min
* Servings: 3-4
