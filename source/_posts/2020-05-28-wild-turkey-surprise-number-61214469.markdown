Yet another variation on Wild Turkey Surprise, aka Stuff with Stuff In It, aka Mess

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Chicken Broth
- 1 cup Royal blend rice, red, brown, wild, jasmine
- 1 pinch Saffron
- 1 t Tbsp Dried minced onion
- 1 tsp Parsley
- 1 cup Chopped cabbage, cole slaw mix works great
- 4 Mushrooms, sliced, chopped
- 1/2 Onion, diced
- 1 Tbsp Minced Garlic
- 1 Tbsp Minced ginger
- Salt & Pepper
- Orange Sauce, GF, i don't know how much i put on, a couple three glugs at least
- 1/8 tsp Thai Chili Garlic sauce, it was still too much
- 4 oz Seasoned Tofu, diced
- 1 palmful Dry Roasted, Salted Peanuts, whole, next time, chopped would be better


## Directions

1. Combine broth, saffron, dried onion, and parsley, mix well. Pour into inner liner of instant pot. Add the rice, give a quick stir and seal the pot for pressure cooking.
2. Set the pressure cooker time for 1 (yes one) minute and turn it on.
3. After it finishes the pressure cooking cycle, let it stand under pressure, natural release for 12-15 minutes. Depress the seal and release the remaining pressure (it won't be much).
4. While the rice is going, add some oil to a large, hot skillet or wok. 
5. Toss in the onions, garlic, ginger, cabbage, and shrooms. Give them a good few minutes stir fryinging
5. Add the rest of the ingredients to the skillet, getting everything mixed, and heated through. Here is where you can adjust spices and such as well.
6. When the rice is done, scoop it into the skillet or wok and mix it all up.
7. Serve. Eat. Save the rest, it'll even freeze.


## Notes

* Prep time: 10 min
* Cooking time: 15 min
* Servings: 2-ish

The orange sauce is not quite right for this. I think tamari would be better. Hoisin would be much better if I can find GF hoisin sauce...

I swear the jar of thai chili garlic sauce keeps getting stronger and stronger, because I need to use less and less. 1/8 was too much in this.
