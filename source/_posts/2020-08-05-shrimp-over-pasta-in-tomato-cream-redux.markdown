Redone to make this gluten-free and dairy-free

Shallots, garlic, wine, tomatoes, and cream make a fabulous fresh
sauce for prawns (or shrimp) and pasta. It is paired with angel hair
pasta here, but feel free to use your favorite pasta. 

Have all your ingredients chopped and ready to go because
this dish only takes about 15 minutes to cook from start to finish.

Recipe reduced from original for 2 servings.

## Ingredients:

* 1 Tablespoon olive oil
* 2 shallots, minced (or 1/3 cup minced sweet onion)
* 4 cloves of crushed garlic (or 2 tablespoons of bottled crushed garlic)
* 1/2 cup red wine
* 3 Roma tomatoes (this is the only kind I will buy from the store) or 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes (drained), chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (crushed to release flavor)
* 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/2 cup almond or oat milk
* 1/2 pound large raw prawns (10-12 count), peeled and deveined
* 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh basil
* 1/8 cup cashew parmesean "cheese" (e.g. "Nooch It!")
* Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
* gluten-free long (spaghetti) pasta, cooked al dente
* Additional chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

## Directions:

1.  Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat. 

1.  Add olive oil and sauté shallots or onions for 5 minutes. 

1.  Add garlic and sauté another 2 minutes. 

1.  Carefully pour in red wine and cook another minute, stirring constantly. 

1.  Add chopped tomatoes, oregano, and basil, stirring to combine. Simmer about 5 minutes for flavors to blend. 

1.  Slowly add almond or oat milk to tomato mixture, stirring while it goes in. 

1.  Continue cooking until reduced and somewhat thickened. 

1.  Add shrimp or  prawns and basil to tomato cream sauce and simmer, turning often, only until pink and opaque. (Do not overcook or they will become tough.) 

1.  Stir in cashew parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to taste. Serve immediately over cooked pasta. 

As mentioned above, you can use sun-dried tomatoes in this instead of
fresh Roma tomatoes. Don't use any other kind of tomatoes unless you
grow them yourself or get them from someone who does. Supermarket
tomatoes (even the organics) are grown to be shipped and have
virtually no flavour.

*update* So, in a pinch, I've used canned tomatoes for this, and it works just fine, so no need to be so strict, really.
