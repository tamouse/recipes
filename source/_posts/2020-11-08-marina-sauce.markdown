excerpt: A very simple way to make marinara sauce that tastes better than jarred.
ingredients:
  - name: olive oil
    quantity: 2
    units: tablespoon
  - quantity: 2
    units: tablespoon
    name: minced or crushed garlic
  - quantity: 2
    units: 15 ounce can
    name: diced tomatoes
  - quantity: 1
    units: teaspoon
    name: dried basil
  - quantity: 1
    units: teaspoon
    name: dried organo
  - name: red wine
    units: cup
    quantity: 1/2

directions:
  - heat oil in a small (2 quart) sauce pan
  - add the garlic and cook until it turns golden
  - remove the pan from the heat
  - add the tomatoes, wine, basil, and garlic to the pan
  - return the pan to the stove on medium heat, bring to a simmer
  - lower the heat and let simmer for at least 30 minutes
  - take the sauce off the heat and let cool
  - using a stick blender, puree the sauce until all the chunks are gone

notes:
  - This would probably work just as well in an Instant Pot if you were pressed for time.
  - I imagine this would last a week in the fridge; freezer for up to 6 months.
