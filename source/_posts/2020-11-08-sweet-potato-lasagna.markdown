excerpt: >-
  The idea for this was taken from a vegan lasagna recipe, but the concept is wonderful
  as a gluten-free and dairy-free option for a meat-based lasagna.

  - name: ground turkey
    units: pound
    quantity: 1

  - name: salt and pepper

  - name: marinara sauce
    units: cups
    quantity: 2-3

  - name: tofu non-dairy cheese
    units: ounces
    quantity: 8
    prep: (toffuti brand)

  - name: cashew parmesan
    units: ounces
    quantity: 4
    prep: (nooch it brand)

  - name: non-dairy mozzarella
    units: ounces
    quantity: 8
    prep: (diaya brand shreds)

directions:

  - Arrange racks in oven so you can cook two trays of sweet potato slices
  - Heat oven to 400&deg;F
  - Prepare peeled sweet potatoes by slicing them thinly, for example with a mandolin. I sliced them into rounds, but you could slice them the long way, too
  - Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper
  - Arrange the slices in a single layer on each pan
  - Put both pans in, one on each rack
  - Cook for about 15 minutes
  - I had some slices that didn't fit, so I steamed them in the microwave instead; it's all good
  - When they're done, set them aside to cool
  - In a medium fry pan on medium heat, add oil or butter to melt
  - When the oil is hot, add the onions and mushrooms, let cook until starting to turn translucent
  - Add the garlic and continue to cook for a couple minutes
  - Remove the mixture from the pan and set aside
  - Add the ground turkey to the same pan and cook thoroughly, crumbling in to small bits. Salt and pepper to taste.
  - When cooked, add in the onion, garlic and mushrooms and mix thoroughly
  - Add a cup of the marinara to the meat mixture and combine well
  - In a small bowl, combine the toffuti, nooch it, and a couple ounces of the mozzarella. You may want to add some nutritional yeast, I did not here.
  - In a 9x13 pan, put a layer of marinara on the bottom, a layer of sweet potatoes, then a layer of meat, and some blobs of the cheese mixture, ending with sprinkling some more mozzarella
  - Repeat with the next layer
  - End with the top layer of sweet potato, and the rest of the marinara sauce
  - Sprinkly more mozzarella on top
  - Bake at 400&deg;F for 30 minutes
  - Remove and let rest for 10 minutes

notes:
  - Okay, this is pretty lightly flavoured, I had a lot more garlic in mine, "but that's my business"

  - If you are using jarred marinara sauce, you will probably want to add a lot more spices to it such as more oregano and basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, etc. You do you.

  - This should make 8 servings, but it was so good I had 1 and a half servings, so plan accordingly. I ended up with 3 servings in the freezer and one in the fridge for the next day, plus a half serving I ate for breakfast the next day.
