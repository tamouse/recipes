  This was a great recipe to start with, and I've added my own twists to it
ingredients:
  - name: BBQ Rub
    prep: see recipe [BBQ rub](/recipes/sauces/2020/11/23/bbq-rub.html)
  - quantity: 2

    name: apple cider vinegar
  - quantity: 1-2
    units: tablespoons
    name: minced garlic
  - quantity: 2
    units: cups
    name: barbecue sauce
directions:
  - Mix together rub and set aside
  - Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs completely
  - Trim excess fat
  - Smear a little yellow mustard on each side of the rib to form a binder for the rub
  - Sprinkle the rub on each side, spreading and working it into the meat
  - Wrap ribs in cling wrap and save in fridge until ready to cook
  - Combine chicken stock, vinegar, remaining rub if any, and garlic in a closeable container, shake well, store until ready to cook
  - Set up Instant Pot, place wire trivet in pot
  - Shake pot liquid well, pour into pot
  - Arrange ribs on edge in a circle on trivet
  - Seal the lid, pressure cook on high for 20-25 minutes
  - Quick release the pressure in the pot
  - Preheat oven to broil
  - Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet, meat side up
  - Cover with BBQ sauce
  - Broil for 4-6 minutes to caramelize sauce, Don't overcook!
notes:
  - I wear nitrile gloves when doing this to get a little extra grip on things. I also use a paper towel to get a good hold of the membrane to pull it off.
  - For the 2020-12-20 version, instead of making the rub, I used Penzey's [BBQ 3000](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/bbq-3000/c-24/p-327/pd-s)
