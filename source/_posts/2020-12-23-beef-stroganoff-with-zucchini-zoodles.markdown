  Inspired on a night when I had a bunch of stew beef thawed, and some zucchini zoodles thawed,
  and was trying to think what to do with them together. Took me a couple minutes, then came up with this.
ingredients:
  - name: stew beef
    quantity: 1
    units: pound
    prep: cut into 1 inch cubes
  - name: olive oil
    quantity: 2
    units: tablespoons
  - name: salt
  - name: pepper
  - name: garlic powder
  - name: vidalia onion
    quantity: 1
    units: large
    prep: peeled and sliced
  - name: mushrooms
    quantity: 8
    units: ounces
    prep: washed and sliced, with stems
  - name: garlic
    quantity: 2
    units: tablespoons
    prep: minced
  - name: red wine
    quantity: 1/4
    units: cup
  - name: "Penzey's Tuscan Sunset spice mix (see note)" 
  - name: zucchini zoodles
    quantity: 2
    units: pounds
    prep: thawed if frozen (see note)
  - name: vegan sour cream
    quantity: 3-4
    units: tablespoons

directions:
  - Salt, pepper, and garlic powder the beef cubes thoroughly after prepping them.
  - Heat a large skillet, add the olive oil.
  - Add the beef to the skillet.
  - Sear all the sides of the beef, then turn the heat down to low and simmner covered for 2 to 3 minutes.
  - "Remove the beef and set aside. (Don't overcook the meat!)"
  - Raise the heat and add the onions, mushrooms, and mince garlic, stirring a bit.
  - Lower the heat and put the lid back on the skillet and let cook down for a few minutes.
  - Add in the herb mix and red wine, stir and re-cover.
  - Add in the zoodles, stir everything up, and re-cover.
  - Add in the vegan sour cream and stir, mixing and heating through thoroughly.
  - Cover and let simmer.
  - Cut the beef into smaller bites, maybe 1/2 inch cubes, and add to skillet, stir in well and re-heat the beef.
  
notes:
  - First time I used one 12 ounce package of frozen zoodles and it was a ridiculously small amount. At least 2 12-ounce packages, but why not just go for 3? Or use a pound of fresh zoodles.

    Penzey's is a great brand for spices, but of course you can roll your own here. According the web site, Tuscan Sunset is hand-mixed from basil, oregano, red bell pepper, garlic, thyme, fennel, black pepper and anise. It's a very pleasant blend, and goes quite a long way. Be gentle with it here, but do find out how much is to your taste.
