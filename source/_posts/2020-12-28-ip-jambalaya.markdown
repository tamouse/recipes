  This made an enourmous amount, probably too much for a single person. Lots went into the freezer for later use.

  - quantity: 1/2
    units: cup
    name: shallots
    prep: thinly sliced - optional

  - name: hot sauce to taste

directions:
  - Dry shrimp with a paper towel, rub with 1 tsp of Creole seasoning and set aside.
  - Press 'Saute' and add oil to inner pot of the Instant Pot.
  - Once the oil is hot, add andouille sausage, and saute until browned, about 6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a medium bowl and set aside. If the sausage browns too quickly, press ‘Cancel’ until the Instant Pot cools down a bit and press the ‘Saute’ button again. Deglaze as needed with a tablespoon of broth.
  - Add chicken to the inner pot, and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to the bowl containing the sausage, and set aside. If the chicken browns too quickly, press ‘Cancel’ until the Instant Pot cools down a bit and press the ‘Saute’ button again. Deglaze as needed with a tablespoon of broth.
  - Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Stir until onion is translucent.  The liquid released from the vegetables should be enough to deglaze the pan.  If it's not, add a tablespoon or more of broth to deglaze.
  - Add thyme, remaining Creole seasoning, salt, worcestershire sauce and stir to coat, about 30 seconds.
  - Stir in chicken broth and bay leaves.  Make sure there's nothing stuck to the bottom of the inner pot - deglaze as needed.
  - Stir in the reserved sausage and chicken.  
  - Add the tomatoes (with the liquid) and spread out with a spatula, but don't stir.
  - Add the rice and gently push down with a spatula till immersed in the liquid, but don't stir in.
  - Close the lid and pressure cook on High Pressure for 7 minutes.
  - Do a quick release of pressure (QR) and open the lid.  [Read More: The Different Pressure Release Methods].
  - Carefully stir in shrimp. Take care to not allow too much steam to escape because the shrimp will cook in the residual heat.
  - Close the Instant Pot and allow the shrimp to finish cooking in the residual heat for about 10 minutes. Jumbo shrimp may require an additional 5 minutes. If you have trouble closing the lid, move the steam release to 'Vent', close the lid, and move it back to 'Seal'.
  - Open the Instant Pot and add parsley. Gently stir the jambalaya. Allow the Instant Pot jambalaya to rest for a few minutes. Garnish with shallots, if using.
  - Serve with hot sauce on the side.

notes: >-
  Prep time does not include steps that are already accounted for in the ingredient list, e.g. cut up chicken, chopped onion, etc.

  Quantity of salt will depend on your Cajun seasoning. If it's more salty, go easy on the extra salt.
  
  If you prefer, you can very briefly saute the shrimp at the beginning and remove.  I find that adding the raw shrimp at the end allows the juices to get absorbed by the rice, without the shrimp drying out.

  This recipe has been modified from the original publication version: tomatoes and rice are layered on top without stirring in to avoid the Burn Message.
