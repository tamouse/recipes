  This was delicious. I very much appreciate Patak's sauces and chutneys. This one uses
  [Koorma Curry Simmer Sauce](https://www.pataksusa.com/product/korma-curry-simmer-sauce).
  This contains some milk, so the recipe isn't strictly dairy-free. I can tolerate it
  though, so it works for me.
ingredients:
  - name: chicken thighs
    quantity: 2
    prep: skinned, deboned, cut into cubes
  - name: "salt & pepper"
    prep: to taste
  - name: red onion
    quantity: 1
    units: large
    prep: sliced
  - name: olive oil
    quantity: 1
    units: tablespoon
  - name: "Patak's Koorma Curry Simmer sauce"
    units: "15 oz jar"
    quantity: "1"
  - name: "Patak's Mild Curry Spice Paste"
    quantity: 3
    units: tablespoons
  - name: turkey
    quantity: 1
    units: cup
    prep: leftover from thanksgiving turkey, chopped into small, bite-sized pieces
  - name: cauliflower rice
    quantity: 1
    units: 12 ounce freezer bag
  - name: cilantro
    quantity: lots of
    prep: chopped, for garnish
directions:
  - Salt and pepper the chicken cubes while prepping the rest of the ingredients
  - Heat oil in a large skillet
  - Add the cubed chicken thighs to the skillet, brown on all sides
  - Add the red onion slices and cook for 2 to 3 minutes
  - Add in the minced garlic, cook until onion and garlic are translucent
  - Add the simmer sauce and the curry paste, mixing ingredients well
  - Turn down the heat to simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, covered
  - Add the turkey, stir through to warm
  - Cook the cauliflower rice according to package directions (using the frozen, steam in bag style seems to work best for me)
  - Serve the curry over the cauliflower rice
  - Garnish with cilantro
notes:
  - The koorma simmer sauce does contain some dairy, but not enought trigger my reactions. It's also loaded with tree nuts and so forth, so it's very much not allergen-free.
  - The koorma simmer sauce has a very pleasant flavour, but is not enough heat for me. Adding the curry paste made a lot of difference.
  - This also needed more salt; the first time we made this, the salt was omitted, and I ended up having to almost over-salt it at the table.
  - This is a real winner, though, I would definitely make this again.
