  So I was on a curry kick and I had a ton of frozen chicken thighs that I wanted to use up
  and this recipe just sort of popped into my head.
ingredients:
  - name: frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs
    quantity: 6
    prep: thawed, rinsed, and cubed

  - name: salt
  - name: pepper

  - name: Penzey's Curry
    quantity: 1
    units: ounce

  - name: red onion
    quantity: 1
    units: large
    prep: peeled, halved, sliced

  - name: vegan butter
    quantity: 2
    units: tablespoons
    prep: halved

  - name: olive oil
    quantity: 2
    units: tablespoons
    prep: halved

  - name: garlic
    quantity: 4
    units: tablespoons
    prep: minced

  - name: mild curry paste
    quantity: 2
    units: tablespoons

  - name: ginger
    quantity: 1
    units: tablespoons
    prep: minced

  - name: crushed red pepper
    quantity: 1
    units: pinch

  - name: ground cumin
    quantity: 1
    units: teaspoon

  - name: golden raisins
    units: handful

  - name: frozen rice cauliflower
    quantity: 12
    units: ounces

  - name: almond-flour soft tortillas
    quantity: 2

directions:

  - After cubing the chicken, put it in a bowl, add salt, pepper, and curry powder, mix thoroughly, and set aside. (I put it in the fridge overnight, but only by accident.)

  - Slice up the onions, saute them in a large, hot skillet with vegan butter and olive oil, cook until soft, set aside.
  - Add more butter and oil to the same skillet, and saute the chicken, browning all sides well.
  - Return the onions to the pan, add garlic, curry paste, ginger, red pepper, and cumin. You may need a little liquid in the pan.
  - Simmer for about 20 minutes.
  - Add the raisins, stir and warm through.
  - Cook the riced cauliflower to the bag's instructions
  - Serve on soft-shell almond-flour tacos, spoonful of cauliflower rice, spoonful of chicken filling (use your own spoons to judge :) )
  
notes:
  - I made this to have some premade stuff to pack in some almond-flour soft tacos (Siete), so I could have lunches for a week or so.
  - "The curry paste I used was Patak's"
