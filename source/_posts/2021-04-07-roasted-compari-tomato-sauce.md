7. Season tomatoes with salt, pepper, basil, thyme

9. Roast at 425 for 30 to 40 minutes, but keep an eye on is so the doesn't burn
10. Heat a saucepan and add some olive oil
11. When the oil is hot, add the other half of chopped onion, more minced garlic, sea salt, ground black pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, crushed red pepper flakes (I prepped these all and put them in a bowl added them all at once)
12. Cook (saut√©) the mixture until the onions turn soft, start to carmelize a bit
13. Add the roasted tomatoes to the sauce pan, stir and let them simmer together for a few minutes.
