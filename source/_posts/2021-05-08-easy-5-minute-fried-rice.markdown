This recipe is derived from [My Favorite Fried Rice](https://www.emmymade.com/5-minute-fried-rice "EmmyMade Favorite Fried Rice recipe") by [EmmyMade.com](https://www.emmymade.com/5-minute-fried-rice). Her recipe feeds 4 people or so, but I only have to feed one, so I've made adjustments.

Really do go read her recipe or watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZbouXa4Dw "youtube video for EmmyMade's easy fried recipe"), she is just an absolute *joy* to watch.

For one serving:

## Ingredients (mise en place)

- 1 cup of leftover "rice": [RightRice]({% link  _posts/2021-05-08-standard-right-rice.markdown %}), take-out rice, etc. Just make sure it's a day old, and cold
- 4 ounces of some COOKED protein: stripy bacon, pork belly, spam, lunchmeat, chicken, shrimp, fish, etc. Not sure why, but beef doesn't quite appeal in this.
- 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots
- 1 green onion, finely chopped; separate the whites from the greens
- 1 tablespoon bottled minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon bottled minced ginger
- 1 large egg, beaten
- kosher/sea salt
- freshly ground pepper
- chicken powder
- sesame oil
- oil for frying

	
## Directions

1. Get everything prepped because it goes fast.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat up the oil.
3. Add the pre-cooked protein and saut&eacute; for 2 minutes.
4. Add the white parts of the green onion, continue saut&eacute;ing for a minute.
5. Add the garlic and ginger, continue saut&eacute;ing for a minute.
6. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
7. In same skillet, add a little more oil.
8. When hot, add the beaten egg, and scramble by pulling the cooked bits into the center.
9. Add the eggs to previous cooked ingredients, set aside.
10. Add a little oil to the same skillet.
11. When hot, add the "rice", pressing into a cake that covers the bottom.
12. Leave to cook undisturbed for at least 1 minute, then stir.
13. Add salt, pepper, and chicken powder, stir well.
14. Press down into a cake and cook undisturbed for an additional minute.

16. Cook for an additional minute.

## Notes

Emmy says you can sub soy sauce for the chicken powder if you don't have it or want it.
