[Right Rice]({% link _posts/2021-05-08-standard-right-rice.markdown %}) is pretty good as a rice substitute, but it can become even better. This is a pretty standard treatment for Asian dishes.


## Ingredients

- 1 Tablespoon grated or minced fresh ginger
- 2 cloves grated or minced fresh garlic
- sea salt
- black pepper
- package of plain right rice
- 1.5 cups water
	
## Directions

1. In a small sauce pan, heat up some olive or avocado oil.
2. Sprinkle in some sea salt, and grind in some black pepper.
3. When hot, add the garlic and ginger, sauteing it to bring out the flavours.
4. Add the right rice, mixing it with the ginger, garlic, salt and pepper, and toast it a bit.
5. Add in the water, stir to bring all the ingredients together.
6. Bring to a boil, cover, and take off the heat.
7. Let steep for 10, fluff with a fork, taste and add more seasoning if necessary.
8. Let sit for a few minutes before serving.

## Notes

Make sure the "rice" is seaasoned; nothing like bland rice to ruin a meal.

Also makes a grand base for fried "rice".
