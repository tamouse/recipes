I got a tri-tip roast from [Butcherbox.com](http://butcherbox.com) and I found a way to make it awesome!

# Ingredients

## Rub

- salt
- pepper
- [Penzey's Justice blend](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/justice/c-24/p-3228/pd-s)
- [cracked rosemary](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/rosemary-cracked/c-24/p-786/pd-s "cracked rosemary")

## Roast

- 1.5 to 2.5 pound tri-tip roast
- 1 large onion chopped
- 4 ounces slided mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- Olive oil for cooking
- 1/2 cup red wine

## Roasting

- 8 ounces baby carrots (saves peeling and cutting üòâ ) 
- 10 ounce package frozen roasted potatoes and onions (or large dice a couple of russets and rough chop an onion)

# Directions

## Prep

1. Thaw tri-tip thoroughly, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Season liberally with salt, pepper, Justice blend, and cracked rosemary, and press into meat. Do all sides.
3. Wrap the roast in cling wrap and leave to let rub infuse the roast. I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.

## Roasting

1. Remove roast from fridge and let sit out to warm up.
2. Set oven rack in lower third of oven. Heat up oven to 425¬∞F.
3. Line a roasting pan with foil. Spray foil with olive oil.
4. Arrange carrots and potatoes in bottom of pan, evenly spread. Spray with oil, stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Add remaining  red wine to the pan.
5. When oven reaches 425, put carrots and potatoes in to cook. Set timer for 20 minutes.
6. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.
7. Add chopped onion, minced garlic, and mushrooms. Add a bit of red wine to the mix once it gets going. Cook until tender. Remove from skillet and set aside.
8. Heat skillet to medium high (7). When hot, sear the roast on each side, long enough to get a decent crust (2-3 minutes per side).
9. When timer for oven goes off, turn it down to 350¬∞F.
10. Remove pan, stir the veggies, keep them even. Add the onions, mushrooms, and garlic from before to pan, spreading evenly.
11. Place a roast rack in the pan, and set the roast, fat side up, on the rack.
12. Return the pan to the oven and cook at 350¬∞F for an additional 20-25 minutes. Check roast temp with a meat thermometer; it should read 125-130¬∞F for medium rare.
13. When roast is finished, remove pan from oven, and set roast on a sheet of foil. Wrap the foil around the roast and let it sit for at least 5 minutes.
14. Scoop the veggies out into a serving dish.
15. After the roast has rested, transfer to a carving board, and thinly slice the roast at a diagonal.
16. Serve roast with the veggies.

# Notes

## Research

For this, I looked at a lot of web sites, videos, and things until I came up with this approach, which is sort of a hybrid of them all.

Some of the web sites:

- [Marinated Tri-Tip Roast with Mushrooms and Garlic](https://www.notion.so/Marinated-Tri-Tip-Roast-with-Mushrooms-and-Garlic-ba3307c5b7bd4345b8d91f885e22baab)
- [Santa Maria Tri-Tip Recipe](https://www.notion.so/Santa-Maria-Tri-Tip-Recipe-d518a077279843f6a3b54e635b74541a)

## Storing leftovers

Wrap the remaining roast in foil, seal tightly and refrigerate. When you want to reheat it, leave it in the foil and heat it up in the oven.

Veggies and be stored in standard food storage. They'll reheat fine in the microwave or stove top in a skillet.

I have no idea about freezing; this would never last long enough for it to get to that point.
