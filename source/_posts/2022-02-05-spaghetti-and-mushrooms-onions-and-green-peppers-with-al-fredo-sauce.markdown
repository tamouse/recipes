# Spaghetti and Mushrooms, Onions, and Green Peppers, with al fredo sauce


Created at: February 5, 2022 9:36 PM

Date Last Made: February 3, 2022

# Ingredients

- 4 ounces Barilla gluten-free spaghetti noodles
- 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms
- 1 medium onion
- 2-4 cloves garlic (if fresh, use fewer)
- 1/2 large green pepper
- 1/4 cup wine (red or white, whatever is available)
- basil
- oregano
- black pepper
- red pepper flakes
- 4 ounces dairy-free butter
- 4 ounces grated parmesan or pecorino cheese
- salt to taste

# Directions

## Mise en place

- Bowl 1: Clean the mushrooms with a paper towel, and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces.
- Bowl 2: Peel the onion, and dice (about 1/2 inch dice), break up pieces.
- Tiny Bowl: If using fresh garlic, peel and crush two cloves. Otherwise use about 2 heaping tablespoons of bottled minced garlic.
- Bowl 3: Seed and roughly chop the green pepper into about 1/2 inch pieces.
- Tiny Plate: Put out the butter so it softens at room temperature.
- Bowl: Put the grated cheese into a bowl to raise to room temperature.

## Preparation

1. Start a large pot with about 3 quarts of water to boil. Add salt to make it taste like sea water. When the water boils, put in the spaghetti.
2. While the water is coming to a boil, also heat up a large skillet to medium high. Add some olive oil to the pan when hot.
3. When olive oil is hot, turn the heat down to medium and start the onions and green peppers. Cook until transparent, turning slight charred but not really caramelized.
4. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for an additional minute.
5. Add the mushrooms, and stir to mix. Leave to cook for a couple minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Add the wine, and stir to deglaze the pan. Let the wine cook down a bit, like 2-3 minutes.
7. Add the basil and oregano. Grind in some black pepper. Shake in some red pepper flakes. Stir to mix thoroughly.
8. The pasta should be fairly done, keep it *al dente*.
9. Using a tongs, pick up the spaghetti and transfer to the skillet. Donâ€™t worry about the water.
10. Add 1/4 cup of pasta water to the mix in the skillet.
11. Add the butter to the skillet, stir to melt it.
12. Add the grated cheese slowly, stirring around to make it incorporate into a sauce.
13. Add more pasta water as needed to make the sauce creamy.
14. Taste and season (you may not need any salt).

# Notes

I used [https://www.vincenzosplate.com/recipe-items/mushroom-alfredo-pasta/](https://www.vincenzosplate.com/recipe-items/mushroom-alfredo-pasta/) as a starting point, mainly for the idea of the sauce and using mushrooms.
